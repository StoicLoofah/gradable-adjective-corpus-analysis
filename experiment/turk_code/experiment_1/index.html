<div class="panel" panel="instructions">
	<div class="instructions natural">
	  <p>We're interested in how natural certain English phrases
  and sentences sound to you. For example, many English speakers feel that the sentence </p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated completely Mary</p>
	  <p>sounds somewhat strange, even though the similar
	  sentences</p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated Mary completely</p>
	  <p>and</p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated completely his audience on Saturday night</p>
	  <p>sound much more natural. We're interested in these kinds
  of feelings -- the feeling that a phrase or sentence is natural, in the sense that you would not find it surprising to hear a native English speaker say it in conversation. We will show you a number of phrases and ask you to make a judgment about how natural they sound.</p>
	  <p>We are <u>not</u> concerned with whether the sentence would be graded highly by a writing teacher, whether it conforms with grammar rules that you might have learned in school, etc. We're only concerned with whether the sentences could be said by a native speaker of English in normal daily speech.</p>
	  <p>For each phrase, we will ask you to select a radio button
	  on a scale from 1 to 9, where 1 means that the sentence is
	  completely unnatural and 9 means that it is completely
	  natural. Don't think too hard about your answer -- there are
	  no right or wrong answers, and this is not a memory or
	  intelligence test. We are just interested in the first
	  opinion you form about the sentences.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="instructions grammatical">
	  <p>We're interested in whether you think certain phrases and
  sentences are meaningful English, i.e. whether an English speaker could reasonably use this sentence to communicate an idea. For example, many speakers would judge that the sentence </p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated Mary happily</p>
	  <p>could not be used by an English speaker to communicate a coherent idea. In contrast, it's easy to imagine the similar sentence</p>
	  <p class="indent">Sam's speech infuriated Mary completely</p>
	  <p>being used. We're interested in your intuitions about this issue: whether you think that a phrase or sentence could be used meaningfully by an English speaker. We will show you a number of sentences and ask you to make a judgment about this.</p>
	  <p>We are <u>not</u> concerned with whether the phrase would be graded highly by a writing teacher, whether it conforms with grammar rules that you might have learned in school, etc. We're only concerned with whether the sentences could be said by a native speaker of English in normal daily speech.</p>
	  <p>For each phrase, we will ask you to select a radio button
	on a scale from 1 to 9, where 1 means that an English speaker
	definitely <u>could not</u> use this sentence, and 9 means that an English speaker definitely <u>could</u> use this sentence. Don't think too hard about your answer -- there are no right or wrong answers, and this is not a memory or intelligence test. We are just interested in the first opinion you form about the sentences.</p>
