This project was done in conjunction with the CoCo lab and, specifically, Dan Lassiter. Perhaps the best way to understand the content of this project is to look at the writeup on the project in presentables/final_writeup/kkleung-fp.pdf

The folders are somewhat unorganized, but pretty much everything is in there. Contact me for better pointers on what's going on.
