This project was done in conjunction with the CoCo lab and, specifically, Dan Lassiter. Perhaps the best way to understand the content of this project is to look at the writeup on the project in presentables/final_writeup/kkleung-fp.pdf

The folders are somewhat unorganized, but pretty much everything is in there. Note that there are 2 related but different steps in the project. The first was related mostly to clustering, and the 2nd more to having a 3-way comparision with the data. Contact me for better pointers on what's going on.
